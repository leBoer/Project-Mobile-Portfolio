## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This project is about putting the lessons from the Website Performance Optimization course to the test.  I have made several changes to the site, and hopefully it is enough to deliver a smooth experience.

### Getting Started

The page that fulfills the PageSpeed Insight score can be viewed [here](https://leboer.github.io/Project-Mobile-Portfolio/).
The result from the PageSpeed Insight can be viewed [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fleboer.github.io%2FProject-Mobile-Portfolio%2F&tab=mobile). (95/96 is what I'm getting)

The page that is optimized for frame rate can be viewed [here](https://leboer.github.io/Project-Mobile-Portfolio/views/pizza.html).

### Optimizations I have introduced

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html



####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html
